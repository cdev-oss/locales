# How to contribute translations

# Guide
- Keep the overall feeling of the bot consistent with the English version.
- Keep the translation clean.
- Do not **translate** or **REMOVE** any variables, such as `{var1}`, `{var2}`
- Do not change the formatting markdown. If a word is \*\*like this\*\*, translate it \*\*como esto\*\*.
- Every translations and changes will be manually review by **cDev team** before served to production/public.
- If you're unsure what a parameter is, you can try using the command or ask in our [Discord support server](https://discord.cdev.shop). We have a specific text channel for translators.
- For languages that are read backwards (compared to english), the `number`s-alike parameters can be moved to accommodate your language reading.
